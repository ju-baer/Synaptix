## 🎯 Key Features

- 🔄 **Live Training Visualization**: Watch forward pass, backpropagation, and weight updates as they happen.
- 🧩 **Modular Network Builder**: Drag-and-drop layers, set activations, adjust sizes.
- 📊 **Activation & Gradient Maps**: See how each layer transforms data.
- ⏯️ **Step-by-Step Debugger**: Pause, rewind, and inspect each computation.
- 🌈 **Custom Data & Problems**: Train on your own 2D datasets or choose built-in challenges (e.g., XOR, spiral).
- 🧠 **Explainer Mode**: Toggle human-readable insights on loss functions, overfitting, or optimization.
